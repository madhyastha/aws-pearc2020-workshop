After you log in, you will see the main AWS Management Console. Take a few minutes to check it out. A search bar is located near the upper left. Recently used services are located below that. Your console may look differently depending on the recently used services. A list of all services can be found below the Services pull-down in the upper left hand corner.

A more thorough description of the console is found here:
https://aws.amazon.com/console/

In general, AWS documentation is found here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/

Support and documentation are also found in the support pull down menu at the upper right of the management console.

**Start by selecting a region** from the pull down in the upper right hand corner. For today, select the **Northern Virginia** region. This region is also known as us-east-1.
