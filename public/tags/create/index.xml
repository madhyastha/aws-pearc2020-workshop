      <description>Now we will create a cluster based on the specifications defined in the configuration file. To create a cluster we will use the command pcluster create and the &amp;ndash;config (or -c) option to use another configuration file other than the default one.
If you were to create your cluster without using the**&amp;ndash;config** (or **-c**) option then AWS ParallelCluster will use the default configuration with the minimum requirements to get a cluster running.</description>

      <description>pcluster ssh is a wrapper around SSH. You can also log into your head-node using ssh and the public or private IP address depending on the case.
 Existing clusters can be listed using the command below. It is a convenient way to find the name of a cluster in case your forget it.
pcluster list --color Now that your cluster has been created you can log into the head-node using the following command in your AWS Cloud9 terminal:</description>

      <description>The steps here can also be executed on any cluster running SLURM. There may be some variations depending on your configuration but that is just to share how generic this procedure is. Except that you are doing it in the cloud.
 We will be running your first &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; job to introduce your to the mechanisms of AWS ParallelCluster. We will have to go through some preparatory steps before.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s now look at what really happens in AWS when you submit a job and reveal a bit of the magic behind your auto-scaling computational resources.
At the heart of AWS ParallelCluster exists an auto-scaling group. It is a logical group of instances that can scale up and scale down based on a series of criteria. In the case of AWS ParallelCluster we have three processes controlling the scaling of the cluster.</description>

      <description>Note: If you plan on working on the next labs then you will want to clean up the ParallelCluster configuration created during that one. Files stored in the bucket and on cloud9 will incur small charges (less than a dollar a month if the tutorial was followed as written.) The cloud9 IDE will stop (not terminate) 30 minutes after the web tab is closed and can be started again, through the console, when needed.</description>
