      <description>You can skip the following step you already have ParallelCluster installed on your AWS Cloud9 instance.
 To return to the AWS cloud9 instance, click on the AWS logo in the upper left corner. Search for, and select, cloud9 from the console search bar. Click on “open IDE” for the cloud9 instance set up previously and wait for the IDE to open. This can take a few moments as AWS Cloud9 will “stop” and “restart” the instance so that the user does not pay compute charges when no longer using the cloud9 IDE.</description>

      <description>For this lab we assume that you have an AWS Cloud9 IDE ready and are familiar with AWS ParallelCluster. If this is not the case, please run through the first half of Getting Started with AWS lab.
 To return to the AWS Cloud9 instance, click on the AWS logo in the upper left corner. Search for, and select, Cloud9 from the console search bar. Click on &amp;ldquo;open IDE&amp;rdquo; for the Cloud9 instance set up previously and wait for the IDE to open.</description>

      <title>b. Create your HPC Cluster</title>
      <link>https://master.d2fvrafk9v089j.amplifyapp.com/04-amazon-fsx-for-lustre/02-configure-pc-fsx.html</link>

      <description>Now we will configure AWS ParallelCluster with a configuration for including parameters to use Amazon FSx for Lustre. If not already the case, it is recommended that your go through the first AWS ParallelCluster lab before doing that one. If you feel comfortable, feel free to continue.
Create an Amazon S3 Bucket and Upload Files We will first create an S3 bucket and upload a file so you can retrieve it using Amazon FSx for Lustre.</description>

      <guid>https://master.d2fvrafk9v089j.amplifyapp.com/03-hpc-aws-parallelcluster-workshop/03-initialize-pc.html</guid>
      <description>Next, you will configure AWS ParallelCluster.
To configure AWS ParallelCluster, you could use the command pcluster configure in a terminal and provide the requested information such as the AWS Region, Scheduler and EC2 Instance Type. However, today we will take a shortcut by creating a basic configuration file, then customizing this file to include HPC specific options.
The commands below generate a new keypair, query the EC2 metadata to get the Subnet ID, VPC ID, and lastly write a config to ~/.</description>

      <title>c. Create a Cluster Config</title>

      <description>Now that AWS ParallelCluster is installed and a default configuration has been created, you will create a configuration file to build a simple HPC system. This file will be generated in your home directory.
Please double check you are using the correct key-pair
 Configuring Your HPC cluster We will be generating a cluster with the following settings:
 Head-node and compute nodes will be c4.xlarge instances. Change the instance type if you like but you may run into EC2 limits that may prevent you to create some or too many instances.</description>

      <title>c. AWS EC2 Dashboard</title>
      <link>https://master.d2fvrafk9v089j.amplifyapp.com/02-aws-getting-started/04-aws-ec2-dashboard.html</link>

      <guid>https://master.d2fvrafk9v089j.amplifyapp.com/02-aws-getting-started/04-aws-ec2-dashboard.html</guid>
      <description>Next, type EC2 into the search bar, click on EC2, and move to the EC2 Dashboard. While instances are generally launched through scripts, they can also be launched directly from the EC2 dashboard. Spend a few minutes looking at the information on this page.
Resource listings and the ability to launch an instance are located in the center of the dashboard while tools and features, such as the saved Amazon Machine Images (AMI’s), Storage Volumes, and ssh keys, are accessed from the left hand side.</description>

      <title>b. Build a GATK Cluster</title>

      <description>Now we will create a cluster based on the specifications defined in the configuration file. To create a cluster we will use the command pcluster create and the &amp;ndash;config (or -c) option to use another configuration file other than the default one.
If you were to create your cluster without using the**&amp;ndash;config** (or **-c**) option then AWS ParallelCluster will use the default configuration with the minimum requirements to get a cluster running.</description>

      <description>AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. We will be using it to introduce you to the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) without the need to install any software on your laptop.
AWS Cloud9 contains a collection of tools that let you code, build, run, test, debug, and release software in the Cloud using your internet browser.</description>

      <description>pcluster ssh is a wrapper around SSH. You can also log into your head-node using ssh and the public or private IP address depending on the case.
 Existing clusters can be listed using the command below. It is a convenient way to find the name of a cluster in case your forget it.
pcluster list --color Now that your cluster has been created you can log into the head-node using the following command in your AWS Cloud9 terminal:</description>

      <description>The steps here can also be executed on any cluster running SLURM. There may be some variations depending on your configuration but that is just to share how generic this procedure is. Except that you are doing it in the cloud.
 We will be running your first &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; job to introduce your to the mechanisms of AWS ParallelCluster. We will have to go through some preparatory steps before.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s now look at what really happens in AWS when you submit a job and reveal a bit of the magic behind your auto-scaling computational resources.
At the heart of AWS ParallelCluster exists an auto-scaling group. It is a logical group of instances that can scale up and scale down based on a series of criteria. In the case of AWS ParallelCluster we have three processes controlling the scaling of the cluster.</description>

      <description>Note: If you plan on working on the next labs then you will want to clean up the ParallelCluster configuration created during that one. Files stored in the bucket and on cloud9 will incur small charges (less than a dollar a month if the tutorial was followed as written.) The cloud9 IDE will stop (not terminate) 30 minutes after the web tab is closed and can be started again, through the console, when needed.</description>
