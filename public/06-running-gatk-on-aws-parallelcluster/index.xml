      <description>For this lab we assume that you have an AWS Cloud9 IDE ready and are familiar with AWS ParallelCluster. If this is not the case, please run through the first half of Getting Started with AWS lab.
 To return to the AWS Cloud9 instance, click on the AWS logo in the upper left corner. Search for, and select, Cloud9 from the console search bar. Click on &amp;ldquo;open IDE&amp;rdquo; for the Cloud9 instance set up previously and wait for the IDE to open.</description>

      <title>b. Build a GATK Cluster</title>

      <description>Now we will create a cluster based on the specifications defined in the configuration file. To create a cluster we will use the command pcluster create and the &amp;ndash;config (or -c) option to use another configuration file other than the default one.
If you were to create your cluster without using the**&amp;ndash;config** (or **-c**) option then AWS ParallelCluster will use the default configuration with the minimum requirements to get a cluster running.</description>

      <description>pcluster ssh is a wrapper around SSH. You can also log into your head-node using ssh and the public or private IP address depending on the case.
 Existing clusters can be listed using the command below. It is a convenient way to find the name of a cluster in case your forget it.
pcluster list --color Now that your cluster has been created you can log into the head-node using the following command in your AWS Cloud9 terminal:</description>

      <title>d. Submit a GATK Job</title>

      <description>The steps here can also be executed on any cluster running SLURM. There may be some variations depending on your configuration but that is just to share how generic this procedure is. Except that you are doing it in the cloud.
 We will be running your first &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; job to introduce your to the mechanisms of AWS ParallelCluster. We will have to go through some preparatory steps before.</description>

      <title>e. Terminate Your Cluster</title>

      <description>Note: If you plan on working on the next labs then you will want to clean up the ParallelCluster configuration created during that one. Files stored in the bucket and on cloud9 will incur small charges (less than a dollar a month if the tutorial was followed as written.) The cloud9 IDE will stop (not terminate) 30 minutes after the web tab is closed and can be started again, through the console, when needed.</description>
